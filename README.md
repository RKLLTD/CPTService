# CPTService
The CPT webservice was developed by Leverage Analytics for RKL to support a Nova Scotia-centric feature analagos to the service codes used in British Columbia for billing. This service is built on the Spring framework and is implemented in Java. The service provides a simple read only RESTful interface to a basic database of CPT codes that consists of a service table and subset table with a single foreign key relationship indicating the service’s membership in a given subset. The data for this table was taken from DennisLee’s gastroenterology subset. This subset is in the resources directory while a MySQL dump of the database is in the mysql database subdirectory. An application.properties file in the resources directory is provided to configure the application. This is a default configuration directory for Spring applications. Also included is a deployment script which can be run to deploy this service directly from a git clone to the tomcat server.The application itself has a standard structure with Controller and Model components. These are connected to the CPT database by a package of data access objects(DAOs). View the wiki for more details including an architecture diagram.
